# Algorithms

My solutions to various algorithmic and interview prep questions.
At the time of making this repo 208 questions have already been solved across sites.
Some but not all previously solved problems will make it here.

My passing solutions are taken directly from each website. As some sites may include non-standard headers or environments I cannot access, solutions here are not generally meant to be run as is.
